description: "In a month I'm starting a new job."

In one month and few days, on the 6th of January, I am starting a new job.
I'm very excited and also a bit scared.

My current job title is Principal Solutions Developer - it is a bit cryptic but basically it means I'm a senior Software Developer.

Now my new title in the new place will be the very prestigious *Head of Engineering*!
Yes, I know it sounds very fancy. But the truth is I'll be the only developer for a while. The company is just starting (yes, it's a start-up! And yes we have a ping-pong table!) and even if we have plans to start recruitment quickly, it takes time to find good software developers.

In the past I've done a bit of management and I've been the Team Lead of nine developers working for a big British bank on a fairly big project.
Still, I realise now that I was not really doing a great job, relying on my memory for task tracking and hoping people would do what I say because I'm a nice guy.
Also, in my current job I am Technical Lead, so I'm supposed to take responsibilities for some parts of the project and I have to influence what people are doing. But nothing like what a *Head of Engineering* is supposed to do.

In the coming months things are going to be very different. In a short period of time I will have to transform the way I work. I'll have to go from a Developer mindset to a Head of Development one. This is big! A lot to learn and discover. Very exciting!

I would like to try to use this blog to document this transformation, to lay down questions I have and answers I found.
Possibly to start discussions and share with you!

There are some many topics! For instance: How do you attract good people? What is a fair and efficient recruitment process? How do you build a good culture in your company? Should we use Python, Javascript? Is Agile dead? ...

I'll keep you updated on Twitter! But feel free to contact me!
