But the truth is I’ll be the only developer for a while. The company is just starting (yes, it’s a start-up! And yes we have a ping-pong table!) and even if we have plans to start recruitment quickly, it takes time to find good software developers.</p>\n<p>In the past I’ve done a bit of management and I’ve been the Team Lead of nine developers working for a big British bank on a fairly big project.\nStill, I realise now that I was not really doing a great job, relying on my memory for task tracking and hoping people would do what I say because I’m a nice guy.\nAlso, in my current job I am Technical Lead, so I’m supposed to take responsibilities for some parts of the project and I have to influence what people are doing. But nothing like what a <em>Head of Engineering</em> is supposed to do.</p>\n<p>In the coming months things are going to be very different. In a short period of time I will have to transform the way I work. I’ll have to go from a Developer mindset to a Head of Development one. This is big! A lot to learn and discover. Very exciting!</p>\n<p>I would like to try to use this blog to document this transformation, to lay down questions I have and answers I found.\nPossibly to start discussions and share with you!</p>\n<p>There are some many topics! For instance: How do you attract good people? What is a fair and efficient recruitment process? How do you build a good culture in your company? Should we use Python, Javascript? Is Agile dead? …</p>\n<p>I’ll keep you updated on Twitter! But feel free to contact me! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New job!","date":"December 04, 2019","description":"In a month I'm starting a new job."}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Genesis/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
